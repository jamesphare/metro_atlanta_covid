# metro_atlanta_covid

I wanted a better visualization of local Covid-19 data than I've been able to 
find, particularly in terms of the number as distribution of cases and deaths
are changing over time. Some charts in this project track confirmed cases and deaths in the 
core Metro Atlanta counties, both in absolute and relative terms. Other
charts track new cases and deaths in Metro Atlanta, Georgia, and the United 
States.

All data come from the New York Times' ongoing [repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) 
of Covid-19 cases and
deaths in the United States.
